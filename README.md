# Temperature Converter
The Temperature Converter is a web application that allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales. It provides a user-friendly interface and real-time conversion results. The project is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features:
Input Fields: The application provides input fields for entering temperature values in Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales.

### Real-time Conversion:
As the user enters a value in any of the input fields, the application dynamically calculates and displays the converted values in the other two scales, ensuring instant and accurate temperature conversions.

### History Display: 
The application maintains a history of previous temperature conversions, allowing users to view their conversion records. The history is displayed below the input fields and updates with each new conversion.

Reset Button: A reset button is provided to clear all the input fields, allowing users to start fresh with new temperature conversions.

## Implementation Details:
The project is structured using the following files:

index.html: This file contains the HTML structure of the application. It includes the necessary elements such as input fields, labels, buttons, and a container for displaying the conversion history.

style.css: The CSS file contains the styling rules for the HTML elements, providing an appealing and user-friendly design for the application.

script.js: The JavaScript file contains the logic and functionality of the Temperature Converter. It handles the event listeners for user interactions, performs temperature conversions, updates the conversion results in real-time, maintains the conversion history, and handles the reset functionality.
